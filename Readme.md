# face-recognition
This is a simple python project to detect known faces in real-time using a webcam and the face-recogintion library.

Compatible with both windows and linux.
Windows users need to use Anaconda and create a new environment.

## Demo
For a quick demo clone/download the face-recognition.py file from this repository and put it in a folder with images of people to be recognised and name them accordingly. 
Also change the names and paths in the "KnownNames.txt" and "PathToImages.txt" file separated by "\n" respectively. Make sure to preserve the order while entering names.
i.e. If first line in KnownNames.txt is "Barack Obama" then first line in in PathToImages.txt should have the path to Barack Obama's image.
