# face-recognition
This is a simple python project to detect known faces in real-time using a webcam and the face-recogintion library.

Compatible with both windows and linux.
Windows users need to use Anaconda and create a new environment.

#for a quick demo clone/download the face-recognition.py file from this repository and put it in a folder with images of people you want to be recognised and name them accordingly. Also change the names in the face-recognition.py file itself.
